To use this plugin simply include the CSS file (batch-css.css). You may need to modify the path to the png img file inside of batch.css depending on how you upload things. I left each CSS name in a specific format to allow you to easily re-name and copy and paste anything you might need for your project. I tried to come up with a naming convention but wanted to get this out quick for fast use of these icons with twitter bootstrap so you're on your own to name things as you see fit.

The naming convention work with a rowxcolumn manner. So branch-icon-2x1 will print out the first column on the second row in the image. Open img/web-icons and you can quickly see what class you need to use for a specific icon.
